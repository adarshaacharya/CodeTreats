# Contributing to CodeTreats
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
3. Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
4. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository with meaningful description and title.
5. Iterate on the solution.
6. Get merged! 


## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/CodeTreats/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/CodeTreats/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

### Note - Commit & PR Title :

It‚Äôs good to have descriptive commit messages so that other folks can make sense of what your commit is doing.
This project uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky/blob/master/README.md) prevent bad `git commit`, `git push` and more üê∂ \_woof!

Read [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) before making the commit message.
